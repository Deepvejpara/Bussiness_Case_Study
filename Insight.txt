• Revenue is customer-concentrated
A small group of customers contributes a disproportionately high share of total revenue, making customer retention a top priority.

• High-value customers drive stability
Repeat and premium buyers provide predictable income and should be protected with loyalty and priority services.

• Monitors and accessories are growth drivers
Products like Monitors, Keyboards, and Mouse generate strong revenue due to consistent demand and repeat purchases.

• Bundling opportunity exists
High-ticket items (Laptops, Mobiles) paired with accessories can significantly increase average order value.

• Offline sales still lead—but marginally
Offline channels generate slightly more revenue, but the gap with online is narrow and shrinking.

• Online channel has high growth potential
With better offers, UX, and delivery speed, online sales can outperform offline in the next quarter.

• West and South regions are strong markets
These regions show higher revenue, indicating effective market penetration and customer demand.

• North and East need targeted marketing
Lower revenue suggests opportunities for localized promotions and improved distribution.

• Balanced regional strategy is required
Instead of over-investing in top regions, focused spending in weaker regions can unlock growth.

• Next-quarter focus should be optimization, not expansion
Maximizing performance of top products, customers, and channels will yield faster returns than launching new products.
